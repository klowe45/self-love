# Self Love

This is a practice project to continue working on my frontend skills while also learning more about backend development.

The website models the needs of a small business owner who offers services and needs a place for customers to get information and book appointments.

## Technologies Used

React.js – for the interface

MongoDB – to support the frontend

##Features

Currently, this project allows the owner to add services for customers to “Book” and then pay for the service.

## Future Plans

-Add stronger security measures

-Improve error handling

-And much more to come
